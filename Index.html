        About Mahendra Singh Dhoni
      </h1>
      <p>
        ☛ Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of
        rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his
        school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenage
        boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the
        district. However, the system failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more
        affluent A-tier states. Consequently, in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work
        as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet.<br><br>
        ☛Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi.
        Inspired by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from
        the more financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour
        to Kenya, where his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against
        world-class bowlers in alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour
        of Bangladesh in November 2004..<br><br>
        ☛ By then a broad 22-year-old with long locks, Dhoni’s India career got off to an inauspicious start, as he
        scored a duck in his first ODI and a string of low scores followed. However, the selectors and the then-captain
        Sourav Ganguly decided to persist with him and gave him an extended run. Dhoni repaid their faith with an
        exhibition of his charisma and audacious stroke-play in his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who certainly didn’t see
        the butchery coming, as he butchered his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he went one step further
        bludgeoning his way to a brutal 183* in Jaipur to make a mockery of a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan attack
        that looked aghast at his bizarre-but-effective stroke-play and the unparalleled physical power that he imparted
        on the ball.<br><br>
        ☛ With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior
        players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.

        On his first assignment in the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Dhoni and his young troops romped to the title in a
        shock victory for the inexperienced Indian side, bringing about the T20 revolution in India. Dhoni's calm and
        composed leadership was widely lauded in the cricketing fraternity after India brought the trophy home, earning
        him the label of ‘Captain Cool’. He was soon handed the ODI leadership as a natural move after his World T20
        triumph, and after the retirement of Anil Kumble in late 2008, the Test leadership was thrust upon him too.
        <br><br> ☛ Dhoni continued to garner praise for his success across formats; especially for his clinical success
        in limited-overs cricket, reaching the pinnacle of his captaincy career during India's path to glory in the 2011
        World Cup. Dhoni’s India knocked out Australia, the holders of the World Cup since 1999, in the quarter-final in
        Ahmedabad. Having gone through a patch of lackluster form throughout the tournament, Dhoni peaked at the right
        time, exhibiting his usual sangfroid on the way to 91* in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka, and lofted an
        iconic six over long-on, triggering night-long celebrations all over Mumbai and the rest of India.
        <br><br> ☛After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came
        under severe scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas
        failures, which included England toppling them over as the number 1 Test side in the world, a fatigued Indian
        side faced a 1-2 drubbing against England at home as India's Test team hit rockbottom. The team's abysmal
        performances in the longer format raised serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his
        sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive proposition, given the poor overall performance of the entire team,
        their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable
        explanations.
        <br><br> ☛ He had started to build a reputation of being one of the most reliable batsmen limited-overs cricket,
        taking India to victory constantly from the jaws of defeat. For instance, his century batting at No.7 against
        Pakistan at Chennai, a stunning 113 walking into the crease when India were 29 for 5, was a knock that
        symbolized the leader MS Dhoni who led by example, as well as exhibited sharp tactical nous: a much sought-after
        combination in a captain.
        <br><br> ☛ After rebuilding the ODI side and phasing out the seniors, Dhoni had a fine run as captain in 2013,
        leading India to their second Champions Trophy triumph as they cruised to the title undefeated, providing a
        welcome distraction from the IPL spot-fixing controversy. This made him the first captain in history to win all
        three ICC global trophies, etching his name in the history books with an unprecedented record and an enviable
        trophy cabinet as a limited-overs captain.

        He led the side to the final of the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh, in which India lost to Sri Lanka in the final,
        and the semi-final of the World T20 in 2016 in India. Dhoni also is the captain of Chennai franchise, one of the
        most successful teams in the history of Indian Premier League, which won back-to-back titles in the years 2010
        and 2011 and also the Champions League T20 in the years 2010 and 2014.

        Dhoni's Test captaincy came under severe criticism, especially after India's continuous losses overseas. Despite
        a Lord’s victory on a green-top in 2014, India went on to lose the three subsequent Tests in England in 2014,
        where Dhoni made some lone contributions, including a dogged 82 in a total of 148 and a few other fifties. He
        countered the seam movement and swing by playing late and walking down the pitch, showing greater application
        than the rest of his line-up with more orthodox techniques. Despite not having the often-talked-about hundred in
        overseas conditions, Dhoni has made several valuable contributions in the lower-order which have immeasurable
        value in the context of the game.
        <br><br> ☛While his chicanery behind the stumps, and the tactical nous to assist the newer leaders may have been
        priceless for the team, the lack of runs and the declining strike-rate were starting to stand out, leading to
        his exclusion from T20Is in late 2018. Despite a fantastic IPL 2018, Dhoni has struggled to make his bat do the
        talking in international cricket of late, as the helicopter stands rusting on the spot it was last seen. After
        the semifinal heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup, Dhoni did not play an international game for India. On August
        15, 2020, just like catches batsmen unaware with his glovework, MS Dhoni surprised the cricketing world by
        announcing his international retirement through an Instagram post that read, \"Thanks a lot for ur love and
        support throughout.from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired.\"

        The journey started with a run-out and ended with a run-out.
        <br><br> ☛MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings is a great yellove story. Ever since the Indian Premier League idea
        spread vigorously among the cricketing fraternity, people wondered which team would pouch the then Indian
        captain. The Super Kings, run by an organisation that knew the nuances of running sports, knew they wanted a
        strong leader to lay a strong base and they made a grand opening by bagging Dhoni for a whopping 6 Crore, the
        highest bid back then. The IPL would be born on April 18, 2008 and on June 1, Dhoni was there leading CSK in the
        final, albeit in a losing cause in a final-ball finish.
        <br><br> ☛ In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the
        West Indies. Earlier that year, he had also been named captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
        <br><br> ☛The result may not have gone his way, but he made a mark with his captaincy and by finishing as the
        side's second highest run-getter. CSK were stopped one step before the final in 2009, but a year later, Dhoni
        made a quirky move against Kieron Pollard in the final against Mumbai Indians by placing a straightish mid-off
        despite having a long-off to get his hands on the coveted trophy after two failed attempts. With three
        consistent years, Dhoni ensured the team made a big mark and they were considered the invincibles of the IPL.
        CSK justified the tag by winning the title in 2011 and came runners up in the following two editions.
        <br><br> ☛ Dhoni was the third highest run-getter in 2013, a season where he fought a lone battle against Mumbai
        in the final. His team team suffered a tough loss in Qualifier 2 against a rampant Kings XI Punjab in 2014,
        another year where Dhoni scored in excess of 350 runs. 2015 was a black mark in CSK's history as the team was
        hit by the spot-fixing saga, but Dhoni led the side to the final among the ruckus, before the franchise was
        slapped with a two-year ban.

        The ban meant all the CSK players were to spread and Dhoni moved to the newly formed Rising Pune Supergiant in
        2016. He spent a quite year, but was back doing what he does best, leading his side to the final, but yet again,
        finished runners-up in a heart-breaking loss to the Mumbai Indians in the final.
        <br><br> ☛ 2018 was a grand re-entry for Dhoni and CSK. The franchise was given an unimaginably rousing welcome
        by the fans, who even took a train all the way from Chennai to Pune to support the team as the matches had to be
        moved out of Chennai. Dhoni was back to where he belonged. He looked fresher, fitter and hungrier. With his
        brilliant power-hitting through the season, he silenced critics who ever questioning his hitting prowess and
        made a strong statement that he is still well and truly alive for the 2019 World Cup.

        After a heart-breaking 1-run loss in the 2019 IPL final to Mumbai, Dhoni led CSK to their 4th title in 2021.
        Dhoni stepped down from CSK captaincy but he got it back from Ravindra Jadeja after a disastrous 2022 season
        which saw them not qualify for the playoffs. Dhoni will be back for the 2023 season and will captain the side.
